            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The Song <i>Walk</i> by Foo Fighters was going 
                to be released in the albulm <i>Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace</i>, 
                but Dave (The Lead Singer) Decided to put it as the final 
                track in the albulm <i>Wasting Light</i> as it made sense 
                to the albulms theme and gave a positive end to the track </p>
                <br>
                I think the fact that they pushed it back into the albulm <i>Wasting Light</i>
                helped a lot with the popularity of the song, because it was put as the last track, and it allowed the song to stand out
                and improved the albulm overall.

            <h2>Instrumentation</h2>
            <p>
                The instrumentation for the song is comprised of 2 guitars, drums, and vocals.
                It Starts out with a single guitar, then we move into the first verse, 
                which is quite calm (relatively), and then builds into a very energetic chorus.
                I think he chose the acoustic guitar at first, but then switched to the electric
                guitar to show the determination that is illustrated by the vocals later in the song.

            <h2>Influences</h2>
            <p>One of the Main Influences of the song came from
                the lead singer, Dave Grohl's experience with helping
                his first daughter learn to walk.  He also said that
                the song was inspired by Kurt Cobain (Lead Singer & Guitar for Nirvanna)
                Kurt Cobain was somewhat of an Idol to Dave Grohl, and he wanted to illustrate
                how much effort Kurt Cobain put into his music.

            <h2>What makes this music good</h2>
            <p>
                One of the things that stands out
                Right Away in this Piece is the guitar
                Solo at the Beginning by Chris Shiflett.
                He added a nice echo to his guitar,
                and it really improves the music.
                His guitar at the beginning progresses 
                through a 4 note pattern that resolves every time which makes you feel relaxed, 
                which is different from the center of the song, where he plays intense chords.
